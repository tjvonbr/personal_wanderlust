## Overview
Wanderlust is an application that offers pre-packaged vacations to potential clients. Instead of having to worry about planning out the vacation hour-by-hour, day-by-day, clients can outsource that task to Wanderlust and focus on the reason to take a vacation in the first place.

### User Flow

2.  You can visit the Wanderlust app to peruse through the catalog of pre-planned vacations and select one that you like--guides would include local activities, restaurants, etc.
